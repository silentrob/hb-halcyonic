A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a 
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases 
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
